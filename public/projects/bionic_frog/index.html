    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>We designed a remotely controlled bionic frog jumping robot. The energy storage mechanism utilizes a cam-driven linkage to compress the spring, and remote control is achieved through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections. Within the specified dimensions of the project, it has achieved a jumping distance of greater than 52cm.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>This project is targeted at the 11th (2024) National College Students&rsquo; Mechanical Innovation Design Competition. The bionic frog&rsquo;s appearance has the following size restrictions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Static size does not exceed 0.1m * 0.1m * 0.1m</li>
<li>Size after jumping deformation does not exceed 0.2m * 0.1m * 0.1m</li>
<li>Total weight does not exceed 4kg</li>
<li>Mechanical energy cannot be stored in advance before the competition, and the jump must be completed within 30 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mechanical-design">Mechanical Design</h2>
<p>If a bionic frog needs to complete a jumping action, three key mechanical structures are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Driving mechanism</li>
<li>Energy storage element</li>
<li>Energy locking and release mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p>We made many iterations of the mechanical structure of the bionic frog. The final implementation version is: using springs for energy storage, and using internal cams and connecting rods to achieve driving as well as energy locking and release.</p>

<h2 id="measure-system">Measure System</h2>
<p>To measure the relationship between the frog&rsquo;s takeoff angle and the vertical force exerted on the ground, we have constructed a test platform as shown in the figure. The frog is fixed on the guide rail through a fixing device to achieve a specific takeoff angle. The jumping board is equipped with two transverse and two longitudinal strain gauges. By using a full-bridge circuit of the strain gauges, an external amplifier, and an NI9221 data acquisition card to collect data, filtering is performed in LabView to measure the strain.</p>

<h2 id="final-results">Final Results</h2>
<p>Finally, our bionic frog meet the requirements of external dimensions, and it&rsquo;s weight is controlled at 156.3 grams, and the farthest jumping distance &gt; 52 centimeters.</p>
