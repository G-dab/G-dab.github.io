Hi there! I am a senior at the School of [**Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), advised by Prof. [**Genliang Chen**](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/chengenliang.html).

I'm a member of the Qian Xuesen Class in Mechanical Engineering, and I have done many interesting small projects during my undergraduate years, Including Wear Testing Machine, Bionic Frog and Humanoid Arm.

From September 20, 2024, to December 20, 2024, I worked at the [**Intelligent Perception Platform Department of JAKA Robotics**](https://www.jakarobotics.com/), development of algorithms for dual-arm robot collaboration.
