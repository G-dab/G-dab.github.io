## Abstract

We designed a remotely controlled bionic frog jumping robot. The energy storage mechanism utilizes a cam-driven linkage to compress the spring, and remote control is achieved through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections. Within the specified dimensions of the project, it has achieved a jumping distance of greater than 52cm.
